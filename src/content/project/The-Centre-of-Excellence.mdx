The Centre of Excellence (COE) at Aananda College is a pioneering initiative aimed at revolutionizing education in Sri Lanka by introducing an innovative STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) pedagogy. This project is the first of its kind in the country, featuring locally developed curricula that transcend traditional methods to emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and practical application.

The COE is designed not only for Aananda College students but will also benefit other children across Sri Lanka. It is envisioned as a catalyst for transforming the national education system, offering a unique opportunity to make a significant impact. The goal is to create an environment where young innovators can envision and shape their future not just at Aananda College but in the entire nation.

#### Specialized Centers and Facilities

The COE will comprise ten specialized centers focused on various thematic areas of practical education, skills development, and job readiness. These centers aim to bridge the gap between academic learning and professional requirements, equipping students with the knowledge, tools, and problem-solving skills needed for real-world careers. By providing in-depth exposure to cutting-edge fields, these centers will prepare students for both local and global opportunities.

The Centre will feature state-of-the-art facilities, granting students access to the latest tools and technologies. From advanced science labs to digital innovation hubs, students will engage with modern educational resources that enhance their learning experience and foster entrepreneurial mindsets. This infrastructure is crucial for delivering the high-quality, future-ready education that the Centre of Excellence promises.

#### Development and Implementation

At the heart of the COE’s development are teams comprising architects, engineers, technical experts, skill managers, curriculum developers designing STEAM courses, and committees for each thematic center responsible for setting up the necessary equipment and infrastructure to steer the teaching process. These teams also include marketing and content management, accounting and auditing, and public liaison experts. All members are skilled professionals from various industries who voluntarily work tirelessly to bring this ambitious vision to life. Their expertise redefines education by offering children opportunities to interact meaningfully with cutting-edge technology, ultimately fostering mindful communities and responsible citizens.

Over the past year, nearly 100 academic and industry experts have regularly collaborated—sometimes twice a week—to develop curricula for the COE’s thematic areas. The value of their work is substantial but has been provided voluntarily without financial compensation. Once launched, these curricula will be offered to the Ministry of Education for implementation nationwide. This initiative has full endorsement from the Ministry of Education.

#### A Vision for National Progress

The Centre of Excellence represents more than a school initiative; it embodies a vision for national progress by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship essential for a prosperous country. By empowering students with necessary tools for success, the Centre contributes to building a brighter future for Sri Lanka. This initiative aspires to inspire other schools to follow suit, creating a ripple effect that could transform the country's education system into an innovation-driven society.

#### Historical Significance and Renovation Efforts

The building chosen for the COE has historical significance; its foundation stone was laid in 1969 and completed in 1973. Referred to as the Science Building or affectionately called “Pasmahala” by Aananda alumni, it had become unusable due to inadequate maintenance. About a year ago, Aananda College's Principal sought assistance from the OAPF (Old Aanandians Professionals Forum) to renovate it. After careful deliberation, OAPF committed to transform this building into a landmark for STEAM education in Sri Lanka.

Constructing a brand new five-story building of approximately 15,000 square feet alone would cost around LKR 532,350,000. Instead of incurring such costs for new construction, this existing building has been fully reinforced to meet modern standards with updated electrical supply, water systems, sewage systems, drainage systems, a new elevator, and air-conditioning system—making it functional once again for this pioneering educational endeavor at a fraction of the cost.

The estimated cost of this project is approximately LKR 376,740,000, with one-third of the budget dedicated to building reinforcement, renovations, and additions. Contributions from our generous donors, totaling around LKR 135,135,000, have enabled us to complete about 90% of the initial redevelopment phase. Once this preliminary work is finished, we can begin installing furniture, computers, electronic equipment, and other essential tools. While we have raised about LKR 135,135,000 in donations, additionally about another LKR 245,700,000 is still needed to fulfill our commitment and empower our children.\
