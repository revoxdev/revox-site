                    We believe technology &amp; design together has the power to
                    create transformation change. From the word go, we did
                    things differently. Instead of a gruelling, up-or-out
                    career, we offered balance and sanity (much needed in this
                    day and age). We value work-life balance and believe that
                    balance brings out the best in you both professionally and
                    personally. We embrace a diversity of people and views. This
                    makes us better and means better outcomes for our
                    clients.Requirment
